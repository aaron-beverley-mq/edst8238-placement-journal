## About
I am Aaron Beverley and have a long and varied career in Software Engineering working for [Motorola](https://www.motorola.com.au/), [Canon](https://www.canon.com.au/), [Optiver](https://optiver.com/) and [The Trade Desk](https://www.thetradedesk.com/). Prior to this I was a scientist working for QML and before that a few part time jobs bartending, merchandising, warehouse work and at a bowling alley. I have 2 graduate degrees, a Bachelor of Science in Microbiology and Biochemistry from [The University of Queensland](https://www.uq.edu.au/) and a Bachelor of Information Technology from [Griffith University](https://www.griffith.edu.au/). Over the past 20+ years I have gather some knowledge, managed some great people and made mistakes. I am at a cross road and have decided to head in a different direction and see if can apply my knowledge to teaching Software subjects in NSW Secondary Schools. I am part of the way through a Masters in Teaching (Secondary) at [Macquarie University](https://www.mq.edu.au/). My hope is that I can help the next generation with learning and understanding the craft of software development and technology. 

I have many hobbies, including gardening and have grown about 50 varieties of fruit and vegetables, I used to be a avid Ten Pin Bowler, I am always up for a grind in some open world PvE game, currently God of War: Ragnarok and when I have some spare time I tinker in my study with electronics, code or 3d printing.
