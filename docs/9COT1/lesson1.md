## Reflection
- Could have gone into more details when summarising the quiz
    - dig into what is NoSQL and why it exists
    - other questions ...
- Need to lock down the layout for Canva better
- Some students were locked out as it needed a login and others decided it was more fun to disrupt others
- Careers could have been broken into smaller chunks. eg: salary, languages, responsibilities rather than all at once
- Quizizz worked well and plenty of engagement
- Should have got the students to bookmark the tools, will do it as a do now in the next lesson
